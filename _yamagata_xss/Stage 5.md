# [Stage 5](https://xss-quiz.int21h.jp/stage--5.php)

**What you have to do:**  
Inject the following JavaScript command:Â `alert(document.domain);`
**Hint:** *length limited text box.*

While looking thtough the code we notice that the textbox has a `maxlength` attribute set to 15:
![5.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/xss21/5/5.1.png)

Let's change that back to a useful value:
![5.2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/xss21/5/5.2.png)

We'll now deliver the payload through this textbox as we did for [[Stage 2]]:
`"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>`.
