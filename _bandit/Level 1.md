# Level 1

Once we've logged in as we've seen in [Level 0]({{ site.baseurl }}/bandit/Level-0) we can see all files and directories inside a directory with the `ls` command.

This will tell us there's a readme file in the riectory we're in (which is /home/bandit0 if you use the `pwd` (print working directory) command). We can read it with the cat command.

This will return a welcome text and the password for Level 2:
